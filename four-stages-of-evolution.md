Throughout our lives, we are always two-sided, possessing both a public and a private identity. On one hand, we are individuals in the eyes of others; on the other, we are capacity for the world. However, we are not always aware of this dual nature. As we move through life, our attention oscillates between our public and private selves. Sometimes our focus is on one side, sometimes on the other.  

There are four main stages in life: the baby, the child, the adult, and the seer.  

In the first stage, as babies, we were unaware of our appearance or public identity. We hadn’t yet learned to see ourselves through the eyes of others. Conscious only of our own point of view—our private reality—we were faceless, vast, space for the world, though we wouldn’t have put it in these or any terms.  

In the second stage, as children, we began to develop a sense of our public identity. Seeing ourselves more and more through the eyes of others, we started learning to take responsibility for ourselves as individuals. In this process, we began to overlook our private reality. However, our attention was inconsistent. Often, we would forget about our public identity, completely losing ourselves in whatever we were doing. But as we grew older, these moments of unselfconscious openness and freedom became rarer and more fleeting.  

In the third stage, as adults, we identify profoundly with our public identity. Seeing ourselves as others see us, we have no doubt that we are what we look like. In this stage, we deny the reality of who we truly are. It would seem that the price of genuinely becoming a person is the loss of our private self. We may not lose it forever, but lose it we must. Many benefits flow from becoming an individual, but even if we are unaware of it, we are now cut off from our center and source. It’s no surprise that we sometimes feel something is missing, that something isn’t quite right.  

Fortunately, this need not be the end of our journey. We can move into the fourth stage—the seer—where we rediscover the reality of our private self and begin drawing on its immense healing power. Seeing who we really are at our center, we start living a truly balanced, two-sided life—private as well as public, public as well as private.  

One of the great gifts of losing touch with our private self as we grow up is that when we return to it, we see it with fresh eyes. It seems we must leave home before we can truly appreciate what home is—and how wonderful it is. And because our individuality does not disappear when we recognize our true nature, we can now celebrate our one consciousness with many voices.  

These stages serve as a map not only for our individual lives but for humanity as a whole. In the distant past, human beings were not very self-conscious; we did not have a strong sense of being separate from the world around us. More recently, we have become acutely aware of being human—of being apart from other life forms and the planet itself. However, this perception of ourselves is changing. There are many indications that we are entering the next stage, where we recognize not only our separateness from the world but also our capacity for it.  

If you are aware now of being capacity for the world, then you are living proof of this shift. Hopefully, enough of us will awaken quickly enough to influence the general consciousness of humanity. The survival of civilization and life as we know it may depend on this shift—on humanity recognizing that, in reality, it is capacity for other species and for the environment.  

In this film, we have presented a traditional spiritual message in modern terms. This message has been expressed in different ways throughout history, depending on time and culture. One way of putting it is that we are not simply human; we are also divine. If we look steadily within at our divine nature, our lives will be blessed.  

Here, we have described this spiritual message in physical terms: we are not, at our center, what we appear to be from a distance. Rather than asking you to believe this, we have carried out experiments to test it and explored some of the implications of living consciously from our center. This modern approach to testing an ancient truth was developed by the philosopher Douglas Harding.

## Highlights
- Human development involves stages of increasing identification with public identity
- A potential fourth stage involves rediscovering our private, boundless nature
- This shift in consciousness could have significant implications for humanity and the environment

## Reflection
How might society change if more people recognized themselves as "capacity for other species and the Universe"?
