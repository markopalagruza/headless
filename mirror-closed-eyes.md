# Mirror, Closed Eyes
## In this chapter we explore the difference between public and private identity through experiments, including looking in a mirror and closing one's eyes. It challenges viewers to directly experience their innermost nature as boundless awareness.

In part 1, we began exploring the difference between our public and private identity through the pointing experiment. We directed our attention outward at things, then inward at ourselves, to see whether we are things at our center or "no-thing," capacity for the world.  

In part 2, we’ll continue this exploration, starting with an experiment involving a mirror. We’ll then proceed with other experiments, examining who we truly are from different perspectives. These experiments invite us to take a fresh look at ourselves and awaken to the blessed condition of our innermost self.  

You might say, "I can’t see my face here, but I can see it in the mirror. Doesn’t the mirror show me who I am? Doesn’t it prove that I’m not space at my center, but a thing—a person?" Let’s look in the mirror and see what we find.  

When I look in the mirror, I don’t just see what my face looks like; I also see where it is. It’s there in the mirror, a couple of feet away—not here at my center. The mirror shows me what I am at a distance, not what I am here at zero distance.  

Here, at zero distance, I’m the opposite of what I see in the mirror. There is my appearance; here is my reality: clear, boundless awareness. When you look in the mirror, you see a different face from mine, but do you see anything different from what I see on this side of the mirror? Aren’t you also looking out of faceless awareness?  

The mirror is a great tool for showing me my appearance. It’s one way I become aware of who I am for others—aware of my public identity. But am I that person here at my center? No. Here, I’m not Richard; I’m capacity for the world. What’s your experience?  

The mirror is a great teacher. It shows me that Richard is there, at a distance—not here at my center. Instead of finding Richard here, I find clear being, boundless capacity that is full of the entire world. What a joy it is not to be a person at my center, but to be the source and container of everything. How wonderful it is that seeing who we truly are is so obvious, so simple, and so accessible.  

You might object, "But we are relying too much on vision. What happens if we close our eyes? Can we still be aware of being boundless, of being capacity for the world?" Let’s close our eyes and find out.  

With your eyes closed, who or what are you? How big are you? What shape are you? Don’t rely on memory or what others have told you. Rely only on what is given in this present moment. Rely on your direct experience of yourself. Do you have a name? How old are you? Are you male or female? Are you even human?  

Here’s my experience: I cannot define myself. I have neither shape nor size. I am formless, edgeless capacity, filled with sensations, thoughts, feelings, sounds, and so on. I find no boundary that separates my experience into "inside" and "outside." Everything is within me—within this awake emptiness that I am.  

For example, my thoughts occur in the same place as the sounds I hear: here, in this no-mind, in this silence. Privately, I am boundless, ageless, nameless—the one in whom the whole world happens. That’s pretty amazing.  

Of course, I still remember my public identity. From memory, I know that, for others, I am Richard. But here and now, I am not Richard for myself. I am capacity for the world. What’s your experience? Privately, here and now, are you a person separate from the world around you, or are you capacity for the world?  

Now open your eyes.  

I find that closing my eyes is no obstacle to being aware of this spacious capacity at my center. It is as obvious with my eyes closed as it is with my eyes open.  

## Highlights
- Mirrors show our appearance at a distance, not our reality at zero distance
- With eyes closed, we can experience formless, boundless capacity
- Our true nature is described as ageless, nameless capacity for the world

## Reflection
How does your experience of self change when you close your eyes and look inward?
