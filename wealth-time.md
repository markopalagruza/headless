At the beginning of the first chapter, I suggested that one reason for taking a fresh look at our identity is that an ancient body of wisdom claims we are not simply human. Outwardly, we are human, but inwardly, we are divine. However, I didn’t ask you to believe this ancient wisdom or accept this claim about our identity. Instead, I rephrased it in modern terms, suggesting that what we are at our center is nothing like any of our regional appearances.  

In other words, what we are for ourselves at zero distance is the opposite of what we are for others, regardless of their range. Then I invited you to look into your center so that you could see for yourself what you are at zero distance. When we see our central reality, we discover that we are fabulously wealthy.  

Here’s a way to illustrate this wealth: hold your arms out in front of you as if embracing your view. From the outside, this embrace isn’t very wide. How much can we hold between our hands? How much can we own? Even if we are rich, there is a limit—we don’t own the stars. But the view from inside is entirely different. The embrace of who we really are is infinitely wide. Between our hands, we find the whole universe. There is nothing outside our being. We are wealthy beyond our wildest dreams.  

But what good is this wealth if it’s private, not public? I can’t do anything with my fields and rivers, my towns and cities, my oceans and stars. This is true—our inner wealth cannot be exploited outwardly or put on display. However, while we cannot spend this secret wealth or show it to others, they can, of course, discover it within themselves. And our own awareness of our infinite wealth confirms the incomparable majesty and glory of who we are privately.  

Our innermost being is truly extraordinary. When we say yes to this miracle—to this infinitely creative, rich, powerful, and loving being within us—its creativity, wealth, power, and love flow into and bless our lives. Keep the door open to this beautiful mystery within you, and you will be guided and helped in countless ways. Can I prove this is true? No, but it is my experience and the experience of many others who have said yes to what we are from our own point of view. If you are willing to look at what you are and say yes to what you find, I am sure you won’t regret it.  

In the remaining part of this film, we will do one more experiment related to time. Then we will explore how consciousness of our private self is a normal stage of human development.  

If we want to know what time it is, we might look at our watches. I see that it is now four o’clock. My watch tells me the time there, at that distance from me, on my wrist. But what time is it at zero distance—here at my center, and there at your center? Let’s have a look.  

Looking at my watch, I see the second hand moving. The hands gradually mark out the passage of time. Movement, change, and time go together. But when I look at my center, I see no movement, no change, no time. Here at my center, I am timeless. I am looking from this timeless awareness into time, yet there is no dividing line between this timeless center and time itself.  

Of course, I am still aware that for others, I exist in time. Publicly, we are all in time, but privately, time is in us. So while outwardly time will outlast us, inwardly, it won’t.  

Psychologists say our deepest fear is death. But when we see that at our center there is no time—and therefore no death—we realize that our deepest fear has no foundation. The fact that our innermost being is not a product of time but the source of time is a truly majestic condition to find ourselves in. No king or queen comes anywhere near the majesty of who we all are at our center.  

However, being majestically beyond time does not mean we ignore the world, for there is no dividing line between our eternal home and the world. Conscious of our timeless inner majesty, we are likely to find ourselves more involved in the world, not less.  

## Highlights
- Staying open to our inner mystery can provide guidance and support
- At our center, we can experience timelessness
- Recognizing our timeless nature can alleviate the fear of death

## Reflection
How might your perspective on life change if you truly felt timeless at your core?
