# Scientific Perspective

Even though I don’t think scientific validation is necessary for the Headless Way to benefit someone, I’m always thrilled when I see scientific thinking pointing in the same direction. Here are a few perspectives, starting with a quote from Erwin Schrödinger:

“Mind is by its very nature a *singulare tantum*. I should say: the over-all number of minds is just one. I venture to call it indestructible since it has a peculiar timetable, namely mind is *always now*. There is really no before and after for mind. There is only a now that includes memories and expectations.” 
-- Schrödinger, *What is Life?: With Mind and Matter and Autobiographical Sketches*, p. 134–135
