## Player One experience 

Headless Way is a fascinating and profound exploration into the nature of consciousness and self-awareness. At its core, the Headless Way is a method of self-inquiry that invites you to directly experience your true nature by recognizing the absence of your own head from your first-person perspective. It is not merely a philosophical concept, but an experiential journey.

Imagine this: as you look out into the world, you see everything around you — your hands, your surroundings — but you cannot see your own head. This simple observation leads to the realization that, from your own perspective, you are headless. This is not to say that you physically lack a head, but rather that your direct experience of yourself is one of openness, spaciousness, and absence of a fixed identity.

The Headless Way encourages you to look for yourself, to test this experience in your own life. It is a non-verbal, immediate recognition of your true nature as the space in which the world appears. This space is not separate from what you observe; rather, it is the capacity for everything you perceive.

This approach is non-hierarchical and deeply personal. Each person's experience and understanding of headlessness is unique and valid.

The Headless Way also emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings, inviting a compassionate and nonviolent approach to life. It is a reminder that while we may appear as separate individuals, at our core, we share a common, boundless nature.

I encourage you to explore this concept further, perhaps by engaging in some of the headless experiments, and see what insights arise from your own experience. Remember, you are the sole authority on what it is like to be you. Embrace this journey with an open mind and heart.

Headless Way was named and structured by [Douglas Harding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Harding) (1909–2007). He gave it to the world as a simple and open framework for experiencing life as a Subject. Think of it as stepping into the role of Player One, to borrow a bit of gaming lingo.

Its benefits are many, from a deep sense of peace and equanimity in the face of life's challenges to the joyful discovery of life as an unfolding adventure, moment by moment. Inspired by these gifts, I wanted to share it here on GitHub as an open-source library.

The content presented here is based on the videos by [Richard Lang](https://www.headless.org/contact/richard-lang.htm), a long-time student and close friend of Douglas Harding, as well as the [Headless Way online workshop](https://headless.glide.page/dl/ddecb1) structured by Gasper Sopi.
