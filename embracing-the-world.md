# Embracing The World
## This chapter explores how we are capacity for our own body and the bodies of other people, the rest of life, the planet. Then Richard guides us through an experiment exploring distance, and then the Single Eye experiment.

Looking in at my center, at the place I’m looking out from, I find capacity—clear, boundless awareness. Looking out, I find the world. The nearest thing I see is my own headless body. You, of course, see your body emerging from the emptiness at your center. Each of us is capacity for our own body. Looking beyond, we find other people.  

Being capacity at center, our consciousness now includes others. There’s a dividing line between our bodies, but no dividing line at center. Looking out, we find many. Looking in, we find one. Reaching out and stroking my friend’s dog, I’m capacity for her dog—face there to no face here. Each of us is capacity, not only for other people but for animals as well.  

Outside, in nature, my consciousness includes the rest of life and the surrounding environment. At center, we are one consciousness. Looking out from this awareness, we find the whole world within us—from this individual human body of ours to the furthest galaxy.  

This view of who we are has profound implications for how we relate to others. Awareness of the differences between individuals, nations, religions, and races is important, but it’s only half the story. If this divided way of seeing ourselves is the only way we see, then it’s not surprising that we experience fear, greed, hatred, and conflict. But if we also see that, at center, there are no dividing lines—that we are one consciousness and all are within us—then surely this awareness will make a difference.  

This isn’t just a nice idea to believe in; we can test it whenever we choose. So the question is, are we going to settle for a half-truth that divides us and leads to conflict, or will we welcome the whole truth—the truth that all our differences are contained within this one consciousness at our center? The future of the world, its peace, and its health may well depend on whether we say yes or no to the whole of ourselves—to who we really are.  

In the remaining part of this chapter, I will guide you through two more experiments. In the first, we’ll see if our inner self is distant and therefore separate from anything. In the second, we’ll observe whether we are looking out of two human eyes or one divine eye.  

There is not one thing in the universe that is distant from our inner self. Between any two things, there is always a distance. Between my thumbs, for example, there is now a distance of about ten centimeters. But what is the distance between anything in the world and the aware no-thing at our center? Measuring between the church there and the emptiness here, the ruler shrinks to a point. Not only that, but there is nothing at center to measure from—nothing to attach this end of the ruler to. The church there is right here, no distance away. Everything is right here, within this boundless awareness at our center.  

How many eyes are we looking out from? For you, I have two, but for me, I have one—a single eye, wider than the world. To bring your attention to this single eye, hold your hands out like a pair of glasses. You will see two holes with a dividing line between them. Now put them on and see what happens to the dividing line—it vanishes. The two holes become one. One single eye, which isn’t even an eye in the conventional sense.  

Hold your hands in front of you like this, then bring them back past your head. Don’t they disappear into your boundless single eye? And as you bring them forward, don’t they emerge from this edgeless space where you are? Whenever we choose, no matter where we are, we can see our single eye—this clear space we are looking out from. And we don’t just see part of it—we see all of it. It’s indivisible. Nor can we see it imperfectly; it is always crystal clear for everyone.  

Of course, each person’s response to seeing their single eye is different, and our own response changes over time. But what we are responding to—this clear inner light—always remains constant.  

## Highlights
- We can experience looking out from a single, boundless "eye" rather than two separate eyes
- This perspective suggests no separation between self and world
- The "single eye" view is constant and clear for everyone, though individual responses may vary

## Reflection
How might seeing the world through a "single eye" change your perception of unity with your surroundings?
