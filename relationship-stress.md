In this chapter we’ll explore how conscious facelessness reveals a radically new perspective on relationships. Then, we’ll look at how being aware of this awake capacity at our center might help us cope better with stress and pain. We’ll also see that our consciousness includes everyone and everything, that we’re distant from nothing, and that we’re looking out of a boundless single eye.  

One area where it truly makes a difference to be aware of our private identity is in relationships. I am aware that publicly I am face-to-face with others. For you now, I am face-to-face with Muka. However, this is just the external view of our relationship. Privately, it is different. Privately, we are face-to-no-face with each other. I have Muka’s face, and she has mine. Let me show you what I mean with the help of a camera.  

Here is my experience: I don’t see two faces, only one—Muka’s. Here, I’m capacity for Muka. Instead of confronting her there with my appearance here, I’m built open for her. She is within me, face there to no face here. From my point of view, Richard has disappeared and has been replaced by Muka. In this sense, I’m not Richard—I’m Muka.  

Looking at me now, do you see your own face at the same time? Are you face-to-face with me or face-to-no-face? Are you living behind an appearance there, closed off from everyone around you? Or are you built open for others? In reality, isn’t everyone within your being?  

Of course, our views out from this space are different. For example, instead of having my thoughts and feelings in your space, you have your own. In such ways, we are different. But I find here at the center nothing that separates me from you. There, I have your appearance. Here, I find this reality that has no one’s face or name on it. It belongs to you, to me, to everyone.  

When we identify only with our appearances, it’s not surprising that we feel separate from others and then act out of fear or insecurity. But when we’re also aware of who we really are—aware of our common identity—our relationships and the way we act toward others begin to change.  

Others are no longer just “other”; they are also ourselves. Being aware that all are within us, that all are unique expressions of this One Self, allows our fear of others to dissolve gradually, and our hearts to open.  

When we identify only with what we look like, we think of ourselves as inside our bodies. Then, when we experience stress and pain, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and trapped. It seems as though there’s only stress and pain, with no way out. But when we see that we’re not inside our bodies—that our bodies are inside us, in this awake capacity at our center—we discover an inner sanctuary that is unaffected by stress and pain.  

Being aware of this sanctuary doesn’t make stress and pain disappear, but it does provide an inner detachment, making them easier to cope with. Here’s an experiment to explore this:  

Look at your hand. I’m not looking at my hand from behind my face here. I’m not distant from my hand; it is given right here in this spacious awareness. I can see the shape, color, and movement of my hand there, given here in this shapeless, colorless, motionless capacity. I can also feel the sensation of my hand there, in this sensation-free capacity here.  

Of course, I identify with my hand—this is my hand, my body, not yours. You have a different body coming out of the emptiness at your center. But I am not in this hand; it is in me. I am my hand because I am capacity for it.  

Right now, my hand feels relaxed. At the center, I am neutral; I am capacity for the relaxed feeling there. Making a fist, I now feel tension there, but nothing changes here at my center. Just as my hand is shaped there but not here, so it is stressed there but not here. At the center, I remain unaffected—free of the stress.  

Gently pressing my nail into my finger, I experience discomfort. The discomfort is there in my hand, not here at my center. When you do this experiment, what do you find?  

Being aware that our innermost being is never stressed or in pain can make a real difference in our lives. When we attend to this safe haven inside us, we see that stress and pain are surrounded by space. They are happening in stillness, in clarity. Stress and pain are real, but so is this clarity—and this clarity isn’t affected by whatever happens within it.  

Being aware of our inner peace and freedom makes it less likely that we will become overwhelmed by stress or pain, or that we’ll add extra stress by resisting what’s happening. Instead, we are more likely to relax and respond calmly and effectively.  

## Highlights
- In relationships, we can experience being "face to no-face" rather than face-to-face
- Awareness of our inner "sanctuary" can help in dealing with stress and pain
- Our innermost being remains unaffected by physical sensations and discomfort

## Reflection
How could the idea of being "face to no-face" with others change your interactions?
