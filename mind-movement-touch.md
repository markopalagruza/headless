# Mind, Movement, Touch
## This chapter examines the location of our minds from both the public and the private perspectives, suggesting that our thoughts and feelings are not confined to our heads but are experienced as part of the world around us. Richard also guides you through an experiment pointing to the stillness at our center, and an experiment that explores whether touch puts our heads back on our bodies.

In the closed-eye experiment, we briefly paid attention to the location of our minds. Let’s explore this further, now with our eyes open. Where are our minds? Are they central, in our heads, separate from the rest of the world? Or are they at large, undivided from the world?  

Others tell me that my thoughts are in my head. I accept this way of thinking about my mind—the public view of me. My mind is here, yours is there. But my private experience is different. My thoughts are not in my head because I don’t find my head here. Instead, I find boundless awareness. This awareness contains both my thoughts and feelings and the world. My mind is undivided from the world.  

Here’s an illustration of this: I’m looking at an apple. From the emptiness at my center, I see its shape and color there from this shapeless, colorless space here. I’m also thinking about the apple: it’s red, it’s round, it’s ready to eat. Where are my thoughts? Others say my thoughts are in my head, but I find no head here. Instead, I find capacity—capacity that is filled with both my thoughts and the apple. My thoughts about things are not distant or separate from those things. My thoughts are out there, connected to the world.  

Obviously, others do not see my thoughts out there in the world, but my experience is different. My mind is at large in the world. I find no dividing line separating my mind from the world.  

It’s the same with my feelings. I feel pleasure seeing the color and shape of this mango. I feel a desire to eat it. My feelings and reactions are not contained inside a person here at my center; they are out there in the world. My feelings of wonder merge with the snowdrops. My excitement isn’t separate from the fire. I am capacity for a world filled with feeling.  

When we live as if our minds are central, it’s not surprising that we sometimes feel full to bursting with thoughts and feelings—there’s a lot going on in such a small space. But when we see that, privately, we are empty of mind at the center, that all our thinking and feeling is out there in the world, a great weight lifts from our shoulders.  

How good it is to be free of our minds at the center, and how our minds love to be set free in this way. When we let them go back into the world, they breathe and expand. We become more creative when we don’t hold on to our minds at the center, when we are consciously open to the Source.  

We also become more warm and generous-hearted when we don’t hold on to our hearts at the center but let them be where they belong—out there in the world. Locating our minds and hearts out in the world doesn’t mean we ignore them or stop being responsible for what we think and feel. In fact, we are likely to become more aware and responsible, not less.  

Our minds and hearts are no longer hidden inside us; they are out in the open, in front of us, so to speak, on display in the clear light of consciousness. As who we really are, we are not only responsible for the thoughts and feelings that flow from within us, but for everything, since everything flows from the incredible mystery at our center.  

Obviously, as people, we don’t create the world. But as this mystery, we do.  

One situation where the difference between our public and private identities is striking is when we move. If we go out for a walk or travel in a car, everyone around us sees us moving. But are we moving from our own point of view? I’m not. Here’s an experiment to see if you feel the same.  

Point at your no-face and slowly turn around. For others, you’re turning while the world remains still. But is it the same from your point of view? Here’s my experience: beyond my finger, I see the room going past, but this side of my finger, I see no movement at all. Here at the center, I’m still. It’s the world that’s moving.  

Notice how this is true whenever you’re on the move. When you’re walking, you’re looking from boundless stillness as the ground moves under your feet. When you’re cycling, you don’t move—it’s the road that’s moving, rushing past underneath you. When you’re in a car, enjoy watching the landscape flow into your stillness. You go nowhere while your destination comes to you.  

If we’re only aware of our public identity, we see ourselves as always on the move. This can be tiring and stressful—we never quite stop, never quite rest. But when we are also aware of our private identity, of this stillness at the heart of our lives, we find profound peace and rest, even when rushing about. Being aware of this inner stillness is deeply relaxing and energizing.  

You might say, "We can’t see our heads, but we can touch them." Let’s test this with an experiment. Touch your head. What are you touching?  

I am aware that, for you, I’m touching my head, but my experience is different. This is the difference between the public and the private. From my point of view, my hand disappears into empty space here at my center. I experience sensations, but they are not happening in a head here—they are happening in boundless awareness.  

These sensations don’t solidify me into a thing. They don’t limit me. Even while I experience them, I remain spacious and at large. What do you find? Do your sensations add up to a head there at your center, inside which you live? Or are you capacity for your sensations, just as you are capacity for everything else?  

## Highlights
- Our private experience of mind differs from the public view of thoughts in the head
- Thoughts and feelings are experienced as connected to the world, not separate
- Recognizing this perspective can lead to greater creativity and emotional openness

## Reflection
How might your relationship with your thoughts change if you viewed them as part of the world rather than confined to your head?
