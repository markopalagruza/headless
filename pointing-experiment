# Pointing Experiment
## In this chapter we dive straight into the discovery of our "faceless capacity" which lies at the center of our being, contrasting it with the usual view of ourselves as a separate person. 

In the pointing experiment, we begin by directing our attention outward, observing that everything we see has shape and color—everything is a thing. Gradually, we direct our attention closer to ourselves until, finally, we are looking in at the place we are looking out of, to see if we also have shape and color—to see whether there is "something" at the center or "no-thing."

** Capacity for the World **
Point at something in front of you and notice its color and shape. It’s a thing. Bring your finger down a little, point at something else, and notice its color and shape—it’s a thing as well. Now point down at the floor. You might see shades and patterns in the carpet.

Next, point at your foot and notice its color and shape—it’s a thing too. Move your finger up your body and point at your knee. Observe the color and shape of your knee—another thing. Bring your finger further up and point at your torso. Notice the colors and shapes there—it’s a thing as well.

Now bring your finger out in front of you and point back at the place where others see your face—the place you are looking out of. What do you see here? Do you see your face? Do you see your eyes, cheeks, or mouth? Do you see any colors or shapes here? Do you see anything here at all?

I’m not asking what you *believe* is here. Put aside belief and take a fresh look. Rather than what you think is here, ask yourself: what do you see here—or not see?

Here’s my experience: when I look inward, I don’t see my face. I see no eyes, no cheeks, no mouth—nothing at all. In other words, I see emptiness. This emptiness is boundless, still, and awake.

I am now seeing what I am at my center, from my own point of view, privately. I will now guide you through an extension of the pointing experiment, which involves pointing in and out at the same time—two-way pointing. This indicates that the space at the center isn’t just empty; it’s also full.

Looking inward, I see emptiness at my center. But I cannot see this emptiness without, at the same time, seeing what fills it—my view outward. This emptiness is filled with my hands, the room beyond, and various sensations, sounds, and thoughts. I find no boundary between the space here and the world out there. My faceless consciousness merges with and becomes the world. Privately, I am the world.

Of course, I remain aware of my public identity—what I look like to others and to myself in the mirror. I am aware that, for you, I am Richard, and I identify with Richard. I identify with my face, my body, my name, my age, my thoughts, and my feelings. In other words, I live a two-sided life: a public self and a private self.

You can see my public self, but my private self is hidden from others—it’s an inner secret. However, I believe that if you look at where you are, you will see your private self, and you will find that your private self is no different from mine.

It has no face, no name, no age—it is capacity. If you are now seeing this faceless capacity within yourself, then we are sharing a wonderful secret: the secret of who we all really are. Of course, your view outward from this capacity is different from mine, but the capacity itself—this boundless consciousness—is the same.

Seeing privately that you are space for the world offers a different view of yourself from the normal perspective, the view of yourself as a person from the outside. Because not many people are aware of their private identity, it may feel like a new discovery. But it isn’t new at all. We have always been this aware emptiness, and throughout history, many have spoken about it.

If you haven’t been aware of it and then you encounter it, it’s natural to question whether this view is valid and true. For example, I can’t see my face here, but I can see it in the mirror. Doesn’t that prove I have a face? That I am not capacity at my center, but rather a person?

Other questions arise too. Alongside questions of validity and truth, we ask about usefulness. If I remain aware of my private identity, what difference will it make in my life and in society? We will begin exploring these questions in part two.

## Highlights
- Our private identity is described as a faceless, boundless capacity
- This view of self differs significantly from the normal, external view
- Questions arise about the validity and practical implications of this perspective

## Reflection
What potential benefits could come from regularly acknowledging your "faceless capacity"?
